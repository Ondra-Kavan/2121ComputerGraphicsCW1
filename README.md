# 2D Scene Rendering in OpenGL 

## Assessment Task

You are required to render an original 2D scene using OpenGL's modelling and rendering features 
as discussed in lectures and tutorials.   The subject of the scene is left for you to decide.   For 
example, you could develop an outdoor scene, the plan view of a building or a scene from a game 
or film.  
You are required to model the scene as a set of separate components, or objects using the 
modelling and rendering features that OpenGL provides.   Your implementation should make use 
of the following techniques... 

* You should use a variety of rendering modes (GL_TRIANGLES, GL_LINES etc.) in your scene to 
demonstrate your understand what these rendering modes do. Your models should contain at least 
vertex position data and additional marks will be awarded for the use of per-vertex colour and texture 
coordinate data.   Also, additional marks will be awarded if you use Vertex Buffer Objects and provide 
your own additional per-vertex data that is then processed in your own modified vertex shader.     If 
you choose to use shaders in your assignment you do not have to use shaders for every object of your 
scene. 
* You will be required to apply texture maps to your objects where appropriate. More marks will be 
awarded for texture mapping more complex objects.   You should use the different texture modulation 
modes to mix the texture image with the per-vertex colour data on your objects to create different 
effects. 
* Use OpenGL's blending feature to create at least one transparent object in the scene.
* Your scene should be interactive, allowing the user to control certain objects in the scene with the 
keyboard and/or mouse and automated transformations.
* As well as modelling single, discrete objects, you are also required to create at least one composite 
object by connecting separate objects, or components together using hierarchical modelling techniques. 
More marks will be awarded for more complex hierarchies.
  
  
You will also be required to explain your design and implementation in a short 5-10 minute code 
demo which will take place in the tutorial sessions after the assignment has been submitted.   As 
part of the code demo you will be required to discuss how OpenGL's modelling and rendering 
features were applied in your application as well as any problems you faced during the 
development of your application and how you addressed these problems.   **The code demo is 
mandatory. If you do not demonstrate your work then a mark may not be awarded.**
  
  
You may use the tutorial or lecture demo code as a starting point for your implementation but this is 
not a copy code and paste exercise. Any code obtained from the Internet must be sufficiently 
modified by yourself and referenced (using comments in the code) to show where this has came 
from. Marks will be awarded for the level of complexity of the scene you are rendering, the quality 
of the objects, or models that you develop and the use of OpenGL's modelling and rendering 
features used to implement each object and the scene as a whole.
  
### Deliverables
* A zip containing the source code, executable and video demo of your implementation. This is to be 
submitted to Blackboard no later than the submission date shown on the assignment front sheet.   
Please name your zip file with your enrolment number (e.g. 12345678_cw1.zip). Ensure the file is in 
accordance with the .zip file format.
* An electronic copy of this document is to be included in your zip file, with your Student Enrolment 
Number filled in on the front sheet and the optional Reflection sheet (see Part C below) filled in 
accordingly. 
* A short video demonstrating your implementation, the results obtained and the problems you faced in 
implementing the assignment. Please note that failure to demonstrate your OpenGL scene may result 
in a mark not being awarded.
